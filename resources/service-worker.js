   * The browser simply sets the 'key' as the resource path, and on retrieval, fetches the contents at that path.
   * In fact, the .add call actually fetches the resource and caches it, so if it does not exist, we will get an error.

   * whenever a change to the service_worker.js is detected, BUT the activate event won't kick in until the page is closed down in the browser and re-opened.
   * So we have a time where the old service worker 'fetch' event is still serving old content - only when the activate event is fired should we delete that content,
   * as at that point we know that the new service worker is active.
